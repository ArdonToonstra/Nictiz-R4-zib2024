zib-HealthcareProvider:
  zib deviations:
    Location.address:
      - datatype: Address instead of a reference
        reason: An address in FHIR is represented using the Address datatype, not as a separate resource.
      - cardinality: 0..1 instead of 0..*
        reason: The cardinality mismatch between the zib (0..*) and FHIR (0..1) is explained by the restriction of FHIR to limit the Location.address to a physical address while the zib allows for other types of addresses (e.g. a postal address). Other types of addresses than a physical address are given in Organization.address which is referenced by Location.managingOrganization.
    Location.telecom:
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        reason: The cardinality mismatch between the zib (0..1) and FHIR (0..*) is explained by the missing root element of zib part ContactInformation in FHIR. Instead, the two containers of the zib (TelephoneNumbers and EmailAddresses), which both have a cardinality of 0..*, are mapped directly into the resource. Thereby this mapping is still honoring the cardinality requirements of the zib.
    Location.telecom*:
      - datatype: ContactPoint instead of a reference
        reason: ContactInformation in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a separate resource. Because the FHIR profile for ContactInformation consists of two parts the root concept of ContactInformation is mapped on .telecom.

unmapped zib concepts:
  - NL-CM:17.2.10: HealthcareProvider.LocationNumber
    reason: This zib concept is problematic to map cleanly to FHIR and it has been deemed too uncommon in practice to warrant an extension.

  ignored issues:
    Location.address:
      - message: "Constraint failed: sd-pg-02: 'If mapping.map exists and the mapping is not implicit, short should exist'"
        reason: The required short description is given by the datatype profile, so it is absent from the differential.
      - message: "Constraint failed: sd-pg-04: 'If mapping.map exists and the mapping is not implicit, alias should exist.'"
        reason: The required alias is given by the datatype profile, so it is absent from the differential.
