zib-HealthcareProvider:
  zib deviations:
    Location.address:
      - datatype: Address instead of a reference
        reason: An address in FHIR is represented using the Address datatype, not as a separate resource.
      - cardinality: 0..1 instead of 0..*
        reason: The cardinality mismatch between the zib (0..*) and FHIR (0..1) is explained by the restriction of FHIR to limit the Location.address to a physical address while the zib allows for other types of addresses (e.g. a postal address). Other types of addresses than a physical address are given in Organization.address which is referenced by Location.managingOrganization. More documentation can be found at https://github.com/Nictiz/Nictiz-R4-zib2020/issues/38.
    Location.telecom:
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        reason: The cardinality mismatch between the zib (0..1) and FHIR (0..*) is explained by the missing root element of zib part ContactInformation in FHIR. Instead, the two containers of the zib (TelephoneNumbers and EmailAddresses), which both have a cardinality of 0..*, are mapped directly into the resource. Thereby this mapping is still honoring the cardinality requirements of the zib.
    Location.telecom*:
      - datatype: ContactPoint instead of a reference
        reason: ContactInformation in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a separate resource. Because the FHIR profile for ContactInformation consists of two parts the root concept of ContactInformation is mapped on .telecom.

zib-Patient:
  zib deviations:
    
    Patient.name*:
      - datatype: HumanName instead of a reference
        reason: A name in FHIR is represented using the HumanName datatype, not as a separate resource.
    Patient.name:
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        reason: The name information according to zib NameInformation may be split up over multiple instances of Patient.name.
    Patient.telecom*:
      - datatype: ContactPoint instead of a reference
        reason: ContactInformation in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a separate resource.
    Patient.telecom:
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        for: NL-CM:0.1.5 (Patient.ContactInformation)
        reason: The cardinality mismatch between the zib (0..1) and FHIR (0..*) is explained by the missing root element of zib part ContactInformation in FHIR. Instead, the two containers of the zib (TelephoneNumbers and EmailAddresses), which both have a cardinality of 0..*, are mapped directly into the resource. Thereby this mapping is still honoring the cardinality requirements of the zib.
    Patient.address:
      - datatype: Address instead of a reference
        reason: An address in FHIR is represented using the Address datatype, not as a separate resource.
    Patient.deceased[x]:deceasedDateTime:
      - short: DateOfDeath instead of DateOfDeath / DeathIndicator
        reason: This element is mapped to two zib concepts, DateOfDeath and DeathIndicator. However, the latter is implicit -- although the zib recognizes both concepts, FHIR supports populating just one of them, thus DeathIndicator is assumed to be true when DateOfDeath is populated. For clarity reasons, the .deceasedDateTime slice has only DateOfDeath mapped to it.
      - datatype: dateTime instead of boolean
        reason: The boolean expected by DeathIndicator is only assumed; see the explanation above.

unmapped zib concepts:
  - NL-CM:17.2.10: HealthcareProvider.LocationNumber
    reason: This zib concept is problematic to map cleanly to FHIR and it has been deemed too uncommon in practice to warrant an extension.

zib-HealthcareProvider:
  ignored issues:
    Location.address:
      - message: "Constraint failed: sd-pg-02: 'If mapping.map exists and the mapping is not implicit, short should exist'"
        reason: The required short description is given by the datatype profile, so it is absent from the differential.
      - message: "Constraint failed: sd-pg-04: 'If mapping.map exists and the mapping is not implicit, alias should exist.'"
        reason: The required alias is given by the datatype profile, so it is absent from the differential.

  ignored issues:
    Patient.address:
      - message: "Constraint failed: sd-pg-02: 'If mapping.map exists and the mapping is not implicit, short should exist'"
        reason: The short description is defined on the datatype profile and not repeated in the differential.
      - message: "Constraint failed: sd-pg-04: 'If mapping.map exists and the mapping is not implicit, alias should exist.'"
        reason: The alias is defined on the datatype profile and not repeated in the differential.
