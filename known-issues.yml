issues should occur: true

ext-LanguageProficiency.CommunicationDetails:
  zib deviations:
    Extension.value[x]:
      - cardinality: 0..1 instead of 0..*
        reason: FHIR restricts Extension.value to a max cardinality of 0..1. To use it more than once, the extension is added 0..* in the hosting element.

zib-AddressInformation:
  zib deviations:
    Address.line.extension:houseNumberIndication.value[x]:
      - datatype: string instead of CD
        reason: The mapping of zib AddressInformation on the FHIR Address datatype is the result of compatibility with HL7v3, which is the format that a lot of healthcare data in the Netherlands is stored in. As a result of this, the zib concept HouseNumberIndication with CD datatype is mapped to a FHIR string datatype.
    Address.line.extension:*.value[x]:
      - cardinality: 1..1 instead of 0..1
        reason: The value of the extension is required, but the extension itself is optional, making the effective cardinality 0..1 as required by the zib.

zib-ContactInformation-TelephoneNumbers:
  zib deviations:
    ContactPoint.system:
      - cardinality: 1..1 instead of 0..1
        reason: Although TelecomType and NumberType are optional in the zib, ContactPoint.system is used to identify the TelephoneNumbers concept itself when this datatype is added to a profile. If only a telephone number is given without TelecomType and NumberType, it will fall in the default slice of the sliced element with datatype ContactPoint.

zib-NameInformation:
  zib deviations:
    HumanName.prefix:
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        reason: Both prefix and suffix are mapped to the Titles concept from the zib. There's a mismatch however in the way this information is represented in the zib and in FHIR. The mapping is documented in the profile.
    HumanName.suffix:
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        reason: Both prefix and suffix are mapped to the Titles concept from the zib. There's a mismatch however in the way this information is represented in the zib and in FHIR. The mapping is documented in the profile.
    HumanName.given:
      - short: FirstName / Initial
        reason: The zib defines both the complete list of first names and of initials as a single string. In FHIR this is done fundamentally different, by using separate names. Hence, the short has been changed to the singular form.
      - alias: first name,middle name,Voornaam,Initiaal
        reason: The first two initials are provided by FHIR. For the singular form of the latter two, see the remark above.
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        reason: See the remark above.
    HumanName.family.extension:*.value[x]:
      - cardinality: 1..1 instead of 0..1
        reason: The value of the extension is required, but the extension itself is optional, making the effective cardinality 0..1 as required by the zib.

zib-NameInformation.GivenName:
  zib deviations:
    HumanName.given:
      - cardinality: 1..* instead of 0..1
        reason: The GivenName is optional according to the zib, but when this datatype profile is used, a name should be provided.

zib-Patient:
  zib deviations:
    Patient.extension:nationality.extension:code.value[x]:
      - cardinality: 1..1 instead of 0..1
        reason: Zib Nationality is implemented using the complex core extension patient-nationality. The .value[x] element representing the concept Nationality has a 1..1 cardinality, but the "code" part of the extension itself is 0..1, making the cardinality effectively 0..1 as required by the zib.
    Patient.name:
      - datatype: HumanName instead of Reference
        reason: A name in FHIR is represented using the HumanName datatype, not as a separate resource.
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        reason: The name information according to zib NameInformation may be split up over multiple instances of Patient.name.
    Patient.name:nameInformation:
      - datatype: HumanName instead of rootconcept
        reason: A name in FHIR is represented using the HumanName datatype, not as a separate resource.
    Patient.telecom:
      - datatype: ContactPoint instead of Reference
        for: NL-CM:0.1.5 (Patient.ContactInformation)
        reason: Contact information in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a separate resource.
      - datatype: ContactPoint instead of Reference
        for: NL-CM:1.1.12 (Payer.ContactInformation)
        reason: Contact information in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a separate resource.
      - datatype: ContactPoint instead of rootconcept
        for: NL-CM:20.6.1 (ContactInformation)
        reason: Contact information in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a separate resource.
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        for: NL-CM:0.1.5 (Patient.ContactInformation)
        reason: The cardinality mismatch between the zib (0..1) and FHIR (0..*) is explained by the missing root element of zib ContactInformation in FHIR. Instead, the two containers of the zib (TelephoneNumbers and EmailAddresses), which both have a cardinality of 0..*, are mapped directly into the resource. Thereby this mapping is still honoring the cardinality requirements of the zib.
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        for: NL-CM:1.1.12 (Payer.ContactInformation)
        reason: The cardinality mismatch between the zib (0..1) and FHIR (0..*) is explained by the missing root element of zib ContactInformation in FHIR. Instead, the two containers of the zib (TelephoneNumbers and EmailAddresses), which both have a cardinality of 0..*, are mapped directly into the resource. Thereby this mapping is still honoring the cardinality requirements of the zib.
    Patient.telecom:*:
      - datatype: ContactPoint instead of container
        reason: Contact information in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a BackboneElement.
    Patient.deceased[x]:deceasedDateTime:
      - short: DateOfDeath instead of DateOfDeath / DeathIndicator
        reason: This element is mapped to two zib concepts, DateOfDeath and DeathIndicator. However, the latter is implicit; although the zib recognizes both concepts, FHIR supports populating just one of them, thus DeathIndicator is assumed to be 'true' when DateOfDeath is populated. For clarity reasons, the .deceasedDateTime slice has only DateOfDeath mapped to it.
      - datatype: dateTime instead of boolean
        reason: The boolean expected by DeathIndicator is only assumed; see the explanation above.
    Patient.address:
      - datatype: Address instead of Reference
        reason: An address in FHIR is represented using the Address datatype, not as a separate resource.
    Patient.multipleBirth[x]:multipleBirthInteger:
      - short: MultipleBirthSequence instead of MultipleBirthSequence / MultipleBirthIndicator
        reason: This element is mapped to two zib concepts, MultipleBirthSequence and MultipleBirthIndicator. However, the latter is implicit; although the zib recognizes both concepts, FHIR supports populating just one of them, thus MultipleBirthIndicator is assumed to be 'true' when MultipleBirthSequence is populated. For clarity reasons, the .multipleBirthInteger slice has only MultipleBirthSequence mapped to it.
      - datatype: integer instead of boolean
        reason: The boolean expected by MultipleBirthIndicator is only assumed; see the explanation above.
    Patient.contact:
      - datatype: BackboneElement instead of rootconcept
        reason: The zib ContactPerson _may_ be represented as Patient.contact. There is a different use case as well, where the ContactPerson is implemented using a RelatedPerson resource.
    Patient.contact.extension:contactPerson.value[x]:
      - datatype: Reference instead of rootconcept
        reason: This is an additional reference to a separate zib-ContactPerson (RelatedPerson) instance, next to the information in Patient.contact. Patient.contact and RelatedPerson can both be used to capture the information from zib-ContactPerson, but each are used within a different context. Information may therefore be duplicated; this is the recommended way.
    Patient.contact.name:
      - datatype: HumanName instead of Reference
        for: NL-CM:3.1.4 (ContactPerson.NameInformation)
        reason: A name in FHIR is represented using the HumanName datatype, not as a separate resource.
      - datatype: HumanName instead of rootconcept
        for: NL-CM:20.4.1 (NameInformation)
        reason: A name in FHIR is represented using the HumanName datatype, not as a separate resource.
    Patient.contact.telecom:
      - datatype: ContactPoint instead of Reference
        for: NL-CM:3.1.6 (ContactPerson.ContactInformation)
        reason: ContactInformation in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a separate resource.
      - datatype: ContactPoint instead of rootconcept
        for: NL-CM:20.6.1 (ContactInformation)
        reason: ContactInformation in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a separate resource.
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        reason: The cardinality mismatch between the zib (0..1) and FHIR (0..*) is explained by the missing root element of zib ContactInformation in FHIR. Instead, the two containers of the zib (TelephoneNumbers and EmailAddresses), which both have a cardinality of 0..*, are mapped directly into the resource. Thereby this mapping is still honoring the cardinality requirements of the zib.
    Patient.contact.telecom:*:
      - datatype: ContactPoint instead of container
        reason: Contact information in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a BackboneElement.
    Patient.contact.address:
      - datatype: Address instead of Reference
        reason: An address in FHIR is represented using the Address datatype, not as a separate resource.
      - cardinality: 0..1 instead of 0..*
        reason: Patient.contact is a restricted representation of contact persons containing only information needed to contact a contact person. The full address information should be captured using an instance of the zib-ContactPerson profile on RelatedPerson, which can be linked using an extension. This is explained in the profile.
    Patient.communication:
      - datatype: BackboneElement instead of rootconcept
        reason: The appropriate representation of zib LanguageProficiency in FHIR is Patient.communication, not a separate resource.
    Patient.communication.extension:languageControl:
      - datatype: Extension instead of CD
        reason: The mapping is placed on the extension and not on the .value[x] because of the nature of this extension. The extension itself contains a .valueCoding that is populated with the value of the zib. This datatype matches the zib CD type.
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        reason: Because of the nature of this extension the cardinality has a mismatch. Three zib concepts are mapped to this extension. Therefore the extension cannot be 0..1, but should be able to repeat.
    Patient.communication.language:
      - cardinality: 1..1 instead of 0..1
        reason: The FHIR profiles are expected to implement zib cardinalities as conceptual cardinalities, but FHIR requires the .language element to be present. This aligns with the intention of the zib, as the Language concept is required for zib LanguageProficiency to make sense.

issues should occur: false

nl-core-Patient-*:
  ignored issues:
    Patient.communication[0].language:
      - message: None of the codings provided are in the value set 'CommunicatieTaalCodelijst'
        reason: The terminology servers used don't know this code system and wrongly conclude that this is an invalid code.

zib-ContactInformation-TelephoneNumbers:
  zib deviations:
    ContactPoint.extension:comment.value[x]:
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        reason: The cardinality of the extension itself is 0..1, making the effective cardinality 0..1 as required by the zib. It seems the QA tooling does not take into account the cardinality of the extension element itself.
    ContactPoint.extension:purpose.value[x]:
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        reason: The cardinality of the extension itself is 0..1, making the effective cardinality 0..1 as required by the zib. It seems the QA tooling does not take into account the cardinality of the extension element itself.

zib-NameInformation:
  zib deviations:
    HumanName.extension:nameUsage.value[x]:
      - cardinality: 0..* instead of 0..1
        reason: The cardinality of the extension itself is 0..1, making the effective cardinality 0..1 as required by the zib. It seems the QA tooling does not take into account the cardinality of the extension element itself.

zib-Patient:
  ignored issues:
    Patient.address:
      - message: "Constraint failed: sd-pg-02: 'If mapping.map exists and the mapping is not implicit, short should exist'"
        reason: The short description is defined on the datatype profile and is not repeated in the differential.
      - message: "Constraint failed: sd-pg-04: 'If mapping.map exists and the mapping is not implicit, alias should exist.'"
        reason: The alias is defined on the datatype profile and is not repeated in the differential.
